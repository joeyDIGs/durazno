# ### Helpful aliases
# --- python
alias pip='python -m pip'
alias pbuild='python3 -m build'
alias pdeploy='python3 -m twine upload --repository jfrog dist/*'
alias pbd='pbuild && pdeploy'
ptest='python3 -m unittest discover -s ./ -p "test_*.py"'

# --- conda
alias clist="conda env list"
alias cact="conda activate"

# --- system
alias dev="cd ~/<your development directory>"


# ### Helpful extra system settings
# exit value is last non-zero (if anything in a pipe fails) or zero (if nothing fails). by default this is set to the value of the rightmost command (so fails in the pipe can happen silently)
set -o pipefail 

# The following can sometimes be necessary for homebrew to work
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
